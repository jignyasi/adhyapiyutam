Excercise Problems

##BASICS
Print "hello world!"
Declare vars "my_name" and "my_age"
print a dynamic statement "my name is DASH and my age is DASH"
Calculate the remainder when 27 is divided by 5
Calculate the quotient when 27 is divided by 5
How much is 27/5?
How much 2 to the power of 10
Declare a var called "my_number" and assign 43 to it
how much is my_number/5? (I'm expecting 8.6)
Declare a var called "my_bool" and assign FALSE to it
Write all the basic truth table operations (there are 4 is suppose)
Declare a var called "my_color" and assign a color of ur choice (between "RED" or "GREEN" or "BLUE")
If "my_color" is "RED" then print "my color is red"...if "my_color" is "GREEN" then print "my color is green"...and so on


##DATASTRUCTURES
Print range of numbers until 50 (it should start from zero)
Print range of numbers from 10 to 25 (it should start from 10)
Declare a var called "my_name" and assign ur name
Print 2 to 4 characters of ur name (for "vamsee"-expected:'ams')
Print ur name in reverse
Sort the characters in ur name and print it (expected:'aeemsv')
Create a list "my_colors" with atleast 4 colors
Join all the colors into a string with "_" between them (exp: "col1_col2_col3_col4")
Print in all upper case and all lower case of your my_name
Add a new color called "SPACE GRAY" to "my_colors"
In the list "my_color" for each color print their third character (use for loop)
In the list "my_color" for each color print their third character (use an inline for loop)
In the list "my_color" for each color print their third character (use map)
Create a list "my_num_list" and populate it with 10 random numbers between 1 to 100(look at from random import randint)
From the list "my_num_list", show all the elements <= 50 (use for loop)
From the list "my_num_list", show all the elements <= 50 (use an inline for loop)
From the list "my_num_list", show all the elements <= 50 (use map)
From the list "my_num_list", show all the elements <= 50 (use filter)
Create a list of 5 numbers([l1,l2..]), another list of 5 cities([m1,m2..]), another list of 5 animals([n1,n2..])...now create a tuple such that we get [(l1,m1,n1),(l2,m2,n2)...]
Create a dict "my_dict" of 5usernames with 5 passwords
For each key in "my_dict" print the 3 character in the password (use for loop)
For each key in "my_dict" print the 3 character in the password (use an inline for loop)
For each key in "my_dict" print the 3 character in the password (use map)
Delete a user from ur "my_dict"
Insert a new user in ur "my_dict"
Create a dict "my_dict2" where for the keys
	'A' -- Value is "my_dict"
	'B' -- Value is "my_num_list"
	'C' -- 'my_color'
Create a list of range of numbers from 0 to 500 and print every even value (exp: 0,2,4,6..)
Create a list of range of numbers from 0 to 500 and print every odd value (exp: 1,3,5,7..)
Create a list of range of numbers from 0 to 500 and print the second number from the end
Create a list of range of numbers from 0 to 500 and print every third number (exp: 0,3,6,9..)
