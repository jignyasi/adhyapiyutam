    Why we need a text editor
    Most used languges for ML: 
        R
        Python
    Do we need to learn both: NO
        1. To avoid confusion between languages
        2. Python has great way to go in the future(Big data components)
    R:
        Advantages:
            Superb lib support
            Extremely easy code
        Disadvantages:
            Poor memory management
            Very slow execution when compared to python
            No proper roadmap for bigdata
    Python:
        Advantages:
            Very fast
            Good progress in big data stack
            OOP concepts
        Disadvantages:
            Relatively small number of libs
            Slightly difficult when compared to R
    Why These 2 languages:
        Vectorized coding principles
        Data Plotting
        Lib
